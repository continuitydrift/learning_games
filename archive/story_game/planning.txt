DESCRIPTION

A simple game in python that will allow players to randomly create stories based on plot elements that they add. 

The game will initially be designed for a single player.

FEATURES

Players will be able to 

-  use a sample set to create a random story with a primary and secondary character, primary and secondary event, and [primary and secondary?] conclusion.

note: for testing/development purposes, I will probably just have one of each element to start with.

-  enter in story elements in three different categories: characters, events, and conclusions.

- randomly draw from these different elements. 

- select from the elements that they like, in order to create a story.

-for fun, create a kind of story in the comments of the program itself


Inspiration for this game is single player RPGs like Ironsworn, but with a focus more on creating viable outlines and story ideas.

Optional elements will be allowing users to "upvote" or "downvote" story elements, which will change their position in an array, affecting the frequency with which they are chosen.

METAGAME

Every stream, choose six things that you want to accomplish, ranked accordingly. 

At the end of the stream, roll a 20 sided dice. If the roll is lower than the total earned points, then you get a positive conclusion or outcome. Otherwise, a bad ending is incurred.

Once a task is completed, it can be replaced by a new task worth the same number of points.

Point total: 13 

SIX THINGS TO FINISH BEFORE I STOP STREAMING (In order of difficulty)

points: 9

6 ~ the player should be asked if they want to keep each element, before it is added to the story.
5 ~ if the player says yes, then the story element is duplicated in the element list.
4 ~ if the player says no, the story element is deleted from the list.
3 ~ the player could also choose to "mutate" the element, and add a altered copy to the list.
2 ~ Stream for at least 50 minutes (until 10:20 CST) 
1 x Begin Streaming
