I'm revisiting this repository after a long time. There are certain tasks that I can undertake to improve it, to get into the rythym of pull requests and commits.

1. Import the quote-machine here.
2. Set it up so that the start.py program runs whenever I start the computer
3. add questions to questions.py
4. create a git.ignore file and figure out how to use it.

















If I type into this file, it should update the word count in the program running from the terminal.

Now, there should be seven more words.

This should now create a new entry.
