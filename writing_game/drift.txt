# Meta

Yes, games in outer space.

The group of friends that loves each other, that represents the kind of kinship bonds you instinctually want to model, hovers over the surface of the planet, which is quite simply an abstract psycho-dramaturgical representation of whatever conflict comes to mind.

The one change I had, and failed, and became embedded as a stage of infinite second chances, a revisitation and reinstallment, but only subquests that can be played at higher levels of difficulty.

Let me be honest. Actually getting programs to work seems difficult right now. Yet in that difficulty a gamification

Another possibility is this: you stay here, in this file, looking at exactly this point of manifesting ink, and it will defeat and encumber you.

"Think," the older woman with curls says, "remember the things you want to take out of the dimensional story." You know that there is limited time and space for all of the things you would like to remember, and experience.

By looking backward with so much love and adoration, part of you fears that you are tilting the bar downwards in the future, that you are poisoning some well of transcendent information. You need to let go of childhood, of the past, logic tells you, but what is logic without the love that gives reason to reason, that embodies the will to put philosophy into practice.

"We only have six scenes," the bar-keeper says, with the smirk of a drifter, "the meta-game is to win by putting as much story into them as possible."

"Here is the reason why letting yourself read previous writing of yours is related to getting over a fear of fond memories, let's call it: both involve a subordination to a previous incarnation of yourself, an abandonment of the principle of teleology, or progressive evolution."

"No."

I'm revisiting this repository after a long time. There are certain tasks that I can undertake to improve it, to get into the rythym of pull requests and commits.

1. Import the quote-machine here.
2. Set it up so that the start.py program runs whenever I start the computer
3. add questions to questions.py
4. create a git.ignore file and figure out how to use it.

















If I type into this file, it should update the word count in the program running from the terminal.

Now, there should be seven more words.

This should now create a new entry.
