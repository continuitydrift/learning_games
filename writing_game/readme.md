The life cycle of my projects seems to be reaching a level of unmanageable intricacy and experimentation, to spawn a simpler version of itself and die.

Prior to the next immolation, I want to get a working, stable version on Github.

# purpose

This writing game is centered around an axis of intent, which is to generate words. It is a gamification of that variable, taking as axiomatic that the goal of writing words is valid.

The direction of play points, or curves, back towards actionable reality, magnetically drawn to accurate models, but also to speculation and variance.

# time

In addition to the overall wordcount, the program can also help track the amount of time spent writing, and therefore use words-per-minute as another statistic.

Some parts of the process may take time, but not result in words added to the count. Players of the writing game can also set goals for the number of minutes they want to spend.

# death

My current idea for the game is this: in addition to the normal text to which the player is attempting to add words, there is also drift.txt, into which less consequential verbiage can be poured.

The first thing I want to be able to do is save daily word counts into a json file.
