# How To Use

If you want to be rewarded in thread, feel free to jot down the time now, so at the end you know how many minutes you spent on this scroll spell, this file.

If you want to be rewarded in good feeling and karma, feel free to start thinking of something you can comment in the Comic Sky channel of the Spindle discord where this was posted.

## counting words: the inevitable failure of strict quantification

In trying to figure out how many words were in this file, I discovered I could either

1. Figure out how to download, install, and activate a plug-in for the development environment I was using, or 
2. just copy and paste the file into a different markdown environment, with a word count feature. I supposed I could have just opened the same file in the new environment, but that runs the risk of conflicted copies.



<!--conflicted copies would be a good name for a sci-fi thriller about clones that hate each other-->

The first would be a longer term, more optimal solution, but the second was immediately available, and wouldn't distract me from the task at hand, which was to assemble a README.md file as an example.

An example of what?

A readme.md file, as a kind of iterable or imicable template, an abstracted form of something real, but dramatically tilted, thematically balanced.

Let's call the first one continuity, the second one drift.

In my current imagining, continuity is a longer time horizon, both future and past.

**How to read**

Continuity Drift is an ambitious series of novels that the current author has an irrational confidence in their ability to create.

I used a they/them, instead of a he, to signify that even in the read mode, I'm thinking of the characters in a kind of thematic schema related to balanced game mechanics. In other words, I'm thinking about how others can replicate all the roles going into the creation of a file or story, including the one I'm currently holding.

Again, we're faced with that choice. And I switch to we because now you are here, at this branching, with me. There are lots of different forkings, though, on this blocky baugh[sp] of ginko, say, so there are several different angles with which to set a trajectory, a plan for a character or world arc <!--in a first person narrative, these might be interchangeable-->. 

I installed the plug-in, but was faced with two problems:

1. I couldn't activate it, or get it to run, and
2. it wasn't designed to count the number of words in the file (although it mostly likely has this as a feature), but rather the number of times particular words occurred in a file. This could be useful for a number of longer-term goals, but is over-designed for the current task of figuring out how many words are in a file, to compare with the end count.

There is a healthy oscillation, I think, between language meant to grow and language meant to nourish growth, then die. All life, all units of selection or reproductive strategies, will eventually change into other things as their environments do. If their environments aren't changing that means things might be dying or unhealthy farther up the spiral, so you need to scale up your paradigm, which would probably involve speciation such that a way of being would become unrecognizable to itself.

**how to play**

So with the long-term goal in mind of a novel, or series of novels (each of which can stand alone) that are *enjoyable to read*, we can introduce a medium-term goal which is to make them *enjoyable to edit* or give feedback on.

My immediate goal, making the game of the Continuity Drift novels (which is writing them) enjoyable, can align with your long term goals of creating your own project, a continuity drifted far enough from this one for you to take profits from it without any obligation to share them with those farther upstream, because in the end water is a loop, not a direction, hydrological breath with mountains and polar winds for organs, distributed according to topographical and geological rules the results of which can be seen, but the exact nature of which never fully described, except with a mathematical engine the size of a planet. Even then, there would be no room in its calculations to calculate for itself, without the nightmare static of logical recursions.

The pacing for files like this is slow, in that they will be filled with asides and comments destined for deletion and forgetting, but quickly in the sense that I can write and post them in between the more drawn out beats of more careful publication.

We can develop rules as we go along (to be honest, I have an extensive ruleset already I draw from for personal use), but the way I imagine you playing the game will be giving me feedback, either random or directed.

For directed, what do you think about the following idea:

1. Create a series of one-for-one NFTs on Algorand, which I can distribute both as rewards and playable game "cards" (characters, settings, objects, and so on). This would involve
  a. short (now->end of week?) solicit feedback on and then create a NFT based on the following section (CONT000)
  b. mid (now->end of month) Use thread and yarn in the same way to reward feedback on 4.md comic sky
  c. long (now->end of year) have a capable, distributed, non-heirarchical team of writers, editors, illustrators, musicians[?] and voice actors to continue selling value-added NFTs in the same series, in whatever way integrates most smoothly with Spindle's larger goals and roadmap.  

# CONT000

<!--anacracy: rules, but no rulers-->
#you #improv #balance #time #acts

You've made your way, following these threads, back to this ball of yarn and thread and the center of the maze. From the end of these books, these games, after having read them once, and played them backwards, doubling back from the periphery. Would you like your memory to be deleted, so you can play again?

## garden state

You are a kitten. For the moment. I am a writer, but the spell of this first and final hex is to drift continuities, to shuffle stats.

Whenever I'm writing a book, I am always gaming out the next one, while dreaming of the last. 

The internet can allow you to sow digital mnemonic seeds and water them. 

Beware the narrow quadratic frames of platforms. Bend them into orthagonally linked lattices of hexagonal narrative tensions.

## ends

To what end? Which will be the same as the beginning, but will make more sense once you've worked your way back here, assuming your memory isn't wiped.

That's just a joke, by the way, a literary or mnemonic device. This file, this origin story (one out of many starts, a summoning spell for willing ghosts)

You and I should figure out the purpose as well as practice.

Allow me to be a little cryptic, using the drifted fragments of previous texts and stories to hover at a distance.

An oracle deck to draw inspiration from, a distant goal you've already reached once, and now can travel in a new direction.

"Level," I told Cn, "could literally be level, for the setting hexes."

From the highest tier, the last step, you can see all the other actions and turns you've taken, in the story and the game.

#maps #masks

## masks

#archetypes #objects #setting

Masks are playable characters. You can paint them, take them with you.

You don't play just characters in this game, but the setting, the map, the objects, story elements, and out-of-game turns and what the are linked to.

They are all in-game objects, tokenized on chains of blocky hexes.

This text [and image] are mutable, supposedly, with ARC69 standards.

They can serve as repositories for the experience points (yarn:minutes) and mana (thread:words).
