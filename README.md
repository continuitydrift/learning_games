4. Make it so you can randomly choose from genres
5. if there is no beginning, middle, or good/bad end for genre, elicit one from player

## error messages
In order to make the development of these games more interesting, I created an array of error messages that would be more interesting than the defaults.
# writing game

As of now, all this game can do is ask you for a daily word count.


# materials
Here is the design philosophy: you have everything you need to do the first experiment, because the first experiment is seeing what you can do with what is available.

In this case, one section of a readme file for a game in a repository no one other than me is following the development of. And also, this open broadcaster software, which I am recording and shunting to an external hard drive.

The hard drive belonged to my ex-wife, and is one of two, the other one having met an untimely death due to the adapter interface being bent beyond repair.

It's 9:00 pm. What do I have to do but this?

The obvious thing to devote myself to doing, until wine or will is exhausted, is the writing_game, although the turtle story hovers in a close second.

One thing I know is that I won't end this video until 9:00. Just kidding, it's 9:02 now. That's the thing, you know, the catch: the loss of time. Yet that is the currency art spends: how does this stack up against hours days months of being alive? How much of you breath and thought did you devote to this creation?

# Meta

Yes, games in outer space.

The group of friends that loves each other, that represents the kind of kinship bonds you instinctually want to model, hovers over the surface of the planet, which is quite simply an abstract psycho-dramaturgical representation of whatever conflict comes to mind.

The one change I had, and failed, and became embedded as a stage of infinite second chances, a revisitation and reinstallment, but only subquests that can be played at higher levels of difficulty.

Let me be honest. Actually getting programs to work seems difficult right now. Yet in that difficulty a gamification

Another possibility is this: you stay here, in this file, looking at exactly this point of manifesting ink, and it will defeat and encumber you.

"Think," the older woman with curls says, "remember the things you want to take out of the dimensional story." You know that there is limited time and space for all of the things you would like to remember, and experience.

By looking backward with so much love and adoration, part of you fears that you are tilting the bar downwards in the future, that you are poisoning some well of transcendent information. You need to let go of childhood, of the past, logic tells you, but what is logic without the love that gives reason to reason, that embodies the will to put philosophy into practice.

"We only have six scenes," the bar-keeper says, with the smirk of a drifter, "the meta-game is to win by putting as much story into them as possible."

"Here is the reason why letting yourself read previous writing of yours is related to getting over a fear of fond memories, let's call it: both involve a subordination to a previous incarnation of yourself, an abandonment of the principle of teleology, or progressive evolution."

"So childhood isn't inferior to adulthood, in term of comprehensive energies?"

"No."

"Before I
 was still figuring out ways to push outwards
 elasticity
  my own ability to return to a sense of consistent self
   after strange voyages."
