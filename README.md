# writing game

#writing #metagame #text #context #ecology #memetics

I'm publishing a novel about comic actors displaced by war in an alternate late 17th century Europe.

This repository, and the improvisational game structure it contains, across different algorithmic substrates, is meant to be useful in playful motivational support in achieving my writing goals.

Hopefully, it can be useful to others, but realistically the algorithms would need re-contextualization and modification, as per the design.

Not design, so much, as **recognition of a niche contribution to an ecosystem**.

## start



## Metagame

This was a program I designed to gamify the process of working on these learning games, giving myself experience points for time that I spend on it, and milestones achieved.

It also has a basic version of the "selective pool", using objects called "fish".

## Quote Machine

First, I want to get code working that simply displays a random quote from a JSON file.

An easy feature to add will be a program that reads from a scroll.json file, and returns a random quote. Users can also add their own quotes, perhaps at a prompt like the following:

```
>>>  
```

## error messages

One feature that I want to enjoy and implement early in the development process is a fun way of giving myself error messages.

# writing game

As of now, all this game can do is ask you for a daily word count.

# evolution

These files are meant to adapt and change over time, but also to have a performative immanence, serving as a reminder to be fully present, no matter how mundane the task of debugging, pseudo-coding, commenting, or documenting.

The fact that I am typing these words, and people anywhere in the world could, theoretically, be watching me type them, is astounding, and the activities I do in the digital ecosystem should, hopefully, reflect a gratitude towards and appreciation of the technologies these programs use.
